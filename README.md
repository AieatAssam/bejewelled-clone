# Princess Puzzle Game

A magical match-3 puzzle game built with TypeScript and Three.js. Help your chosen princess collect gems while avoiding the mischievous dragon!

## Features

- **6 Unique Princesses** - Choose from Aurora, Marina, Ivy, Ember, Luna, or Crystal, each with their own color theme
- **Beautiful 3D Gems** - Sparkling rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, amethysts, gold bracelets, and pearl earrings
- **Dragon Threat System** - Make small matches and the dragon gets angry! Create big combos to calm him down
- **Fairy Dust Power** - Spend gems to shuffle the board when you're stuck

- **Responsive Controls** - Click, drag, or swipe to swap gems

## How to Play

1. **Select a Princess** - Choose your favorite princess to begin
2. **Match Gems** - Swap adjacent gems to create matches of 3 or more
3. **Collect Treasure** - Matched gems go into your purse
4. **Avoid the Dragon** - Making only small (3-gem) matches angers the dragon. He'll swoop in and steal your gems!
5. **Create Combos** - Match 4+ gems or create cascades to reduce dragon threat and earn more gems

## Game Mechanics

### Scoring
- Gems collected are counted (not arbitrary points)
- Dragon steals gems if you make 3 consecutive small matches

### Dragon Threat
- Single 3-gem matches **increase** threat
- 4+ gem matches **decrease** threat
- Cascades (chain reactions) **decrease** threat
- At full threat, dragon attacks and steals 1-5 gems

### Special Features
- **Hint System** - Highlights a valid move with pulsing animation
- **Fairy Dust** - Emergency shuffle when stuck (costs gems)
- **Flying Gem Animation** - Collected gems fly into your purse
- **Cascade Visibility** - See each cascade level as it happens
